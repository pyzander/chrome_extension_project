<!-- Introducing a user interface. 
  This extension uses a button to change the background color.
  Like the background script, this file needs to be designated as a popup in the manifest under page_action.
  Because page_action is declared in the manifest, it is up to the extension to tell the browser when the user can interact with popup.html.
